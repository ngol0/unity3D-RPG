# unity3D-RPG
A Unity3D RPG project which is in progres. 

Everything is still buggy and not finished. The scene is a sandbox and the main function here is to run around and if enemies are within certain range, they will chase after you to fight. You can fight back but after defeating the enemies it's a bit weird and buggy.
